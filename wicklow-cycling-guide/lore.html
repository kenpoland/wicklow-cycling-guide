    <h2>🧚 Wicklow’s Enchanted Tales</h2>

    <div class="site">
      <h3>🕊️ Glendalough – The Blackbird & The Stone</h3>
      <p>St. Kevin was said to have held out his hand in prayer so long that a <span class="highlight">blackbird nested in it</span> and hatched her chicks. Nearby, a <span class="gold">stone bowl</span> called the Deer Stone still “fills with milk” to feed orphaned children. Magic or miracle?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="site">
      <h3>💧 Glenmacnass Waterfall – Spirits in the Mist</h3>
      <p>Rebels once hid here during the 1798 uprising. Local legend claims the <span class="gold">mists carry their voices</span>, and that <span class="highlight">nature spirits</span> dance by the waterfall at dusk.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="site">
      <h3>🍺 Lough Tay – Portal to the Otherworld</h3>
      <p>Its still waters and crescent-shaped shoreline resemble a pint of Guinness. But some call it a <span class="highlight">fairy lake</span>, where timeless music drifts across the hills under moonlight.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="site">
      <h3>🏰 Castle Kevin (Annamoe) – Betrayed & Bound</h3>
      <p>Only ruins remain, but villagers whisper that a <span class="gold">betrayed constable</span> haunts the castle ruins. On midsummer nights, <span class="highlight">fairy lights</span> flicker along the riverside like distant lanterns.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="site">
      <h3>🐕 Roundwood – The Watchful Giant</h3>
      <p>They say a <span class="gold">giant sheepdog</span> once protected Roundwood from raiders, so fierce its spirit still lingers in the fog. Some riders claim to hear distant paws on misty trails.</p>
